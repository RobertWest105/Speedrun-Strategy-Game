# Speedrun Strategy Game
A simple strategy game made in Unity using C#.

All maps are randomly generated based on parameters (height, width, mountain density and forest density), which can be set in the main menu.

There are two modes: single-player and 2-player versus.

Player 1 controls the blue team starting in the bottom left and player 2 controls the red team starting in the top right. Defeat all of the opposing units to win.
